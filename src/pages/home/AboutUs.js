        Panchayati Raj system in Himachal Pradesh was established in a statutory
        form under the provisions of the Himachal Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act,
        1952 in the year 1954. Only 280 Gram Panchayats existed prior to the
        enactment of the Himachal Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1952. However,
        after the enactment of the said Act, 466 Gram Panchayats were
        established in the year 1954 and the number of Gram Panchayats was
        increased to 638 during the year 1962. On 1st November, 1966, the hilly
        areas of Punjab were merged in this State and consequently the number of
        Gram Panchayats rose to 1695. In the merged area, a three tier
        Panchayati Raj system was in existence under the provisions of Punjab
        Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad Act, whereas two tier system was
        prevalent in this State. With a view to bring uniformity in the
        Panchayati Raj system of the old and the newly merged areas, the
        Himachal Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1968 was enacted on 15th November,
        1970 in this State and the two tier Panchayati Raj system was
        established throughout the State. Besides this the Nayaya Panchayats
        were also in existence in this State for discharging judicial functions,
        but during the year 1977 the Nayaya Panchayats were abolished and the
        judicial functions were transferred to the Gram Panchayats. After the
        enactment of the said Act in the year 1970 the existing Gram Sabhas were
        reorganised/bifurcated from time to time and new Gram Sabhas/Gram
        Panchayats were established.
